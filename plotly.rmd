### Problem 2

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

```{r Italian_rest}
data("rest_inspec")

Italian_rest=
  rest_inspec %>%
  filter(
    grade %in% c("A", "B", "C"),
    str_detect(cuisine_description, "Italian"),
    boro != "0") %>% 
  relocate(boro) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  sample_n(10000) %>% 
  view()
```


## Scatterplot 
## Italian restaurant score across inspection date in the 5 boroughs


```{r}
Italian_rest %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Score: ", score, "\nGrade: ", grade)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~inspection_date, y = ~score, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~boro, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.8)

```

## Boxplot 
## Distribution of health scores for Italian restaurants by boro 

```{r}
Italian_rest %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~score, color = ~boro, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```


## Bar Chart 
## Number of Italian restaurants inspected per boro


```{r}
Italian_rest %>% 
  count(boro) %>% 
   mutate(boro = fct_reorder(boro, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~boro, y = ~n, color = ~boro, type = "bar", colors = "viridis", showlegend = FALSE)
```
